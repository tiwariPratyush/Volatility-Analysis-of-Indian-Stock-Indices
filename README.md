# Indian Stock Market Volatility Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts volatility for major Indian stock market indices using historical data and various regression models.

##  Overview

This project analyzes and predicts volatility for three major Indian stock market indices:
- **NIFTY 50** - India's benchmark stock market index
- **NIFTY NEXT 50** - Index of the next 50 large-cap stocks
- **BANK NIFTY** - Banking sector index

The project implements multiple machine learning models to predict market volatility using technical indicators and historical price data.

##  Features

- **Data Processing**: Automated data cleaning and preprocessing for multiple stock indices
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of technical indicators including:
  - Daily returns
  - Moving averages (5-day and 10-day)
  - Rolling volatility measures
  - Lag features for time series analysis
- **Multiple ML Models**: Implementation of 5 different regression models:
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
  - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Linear Regression
- **Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R¬≤ metrics
- **Visualization**: Actual vs predicted volatility plots for model comparison

##  Data Format

The CSV files should contain the following columns:
- `Date`: Trading date
- `Open`: Opening price
- `High`: Highest price of the day
- `Low`: Lowest price of the day
- `Close`: Closing price
- `Volume`: Trading volume (optional)

##  Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Place your data files** in the `data/` directory with the following names:
   - `NIFTY50.csv`
   - `NIFTYNEXT50.csv`
   - `BANKNIFTY.csv`

2. **Run the main script**
   ```bash
   python src/volatility_prediction.py
   ```

### Jupyter Notebook

For interactive analysis, use the provided Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/volatility_analysis.ipynb
```

### Customization

You can modify the following parameters in the script:
- **Feature engineering window sizes**: Adjust moving average periods
- **Train-test split ratio**: Default is 80-20 split
- **Model hyperparameters**: Tune model-specific parameters
- **Evaluation metrics**: Add or modify performance metrics

##  Model Performance

The project evaluates models using multiple metrics:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **MAE** | Mean Absolute Error - Average prediction error |
| **MSE** | Mean Squared Error - Squared prediction error |
| **RMSE** | Root Mean Squared Error - Standard deviation of errors |
| **R¬≤** | Coefficient of determination - Variance explained |

##  Results

The models are compared across all three indices, with results showing:
- **Random Forest** typically performs best for volatility prediction
- **Gradient Boosting** shows competitive performance
- **Linear models** provide baseline performance for comparison

Sample output:
```
NIFTY50 Model Comparison:
Model                    MAE      MSE      RMSE     R¬≤
Random Forest           0.003245  0.000021  0.004612  0.847
Gradient Boosting       0.003456  0.000024  0.004899  0.823
Support Vector Regressor 0.004123  0.000032  0.005657  0.765
```

##  Technical Details

### Feature Engineering
- **Volatility Calculation**: `(High - Low) / Open`
- **Rolling Statistics**: Moving averages and standard deviations
- **Lag Features**: Previous period volatility for time series context
- **Returns**: Percentage change in closing prices

### Time Series Considerations
- **Chronological Splitting**: Train-test split maintains temporal order
- **No Data Leakage**: Future information excluded from training
- **Stationarity**: Features designed to capture market dynamics

##  Visualization

The project generates several visualizations:
- Actual vs Predicted volatility time series
- Model performance comparison charts
- Feature importance plots (for tree-based models)
